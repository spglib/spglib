Spglib is a library for finding and handling crystal symmetries
written in C. There are the [python](python-interface.md),
{ref}`fortran, rust, and ruby <interfaces>` interfaces.

The detailed algorithm of spglib is described the following text:

- "$\texttt{Spglib}$: a software library for crystal symmetry search",
  Atsushi Togo and Isao Tanaka,
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01590> (written at version 1.10.4)

## Requirements

- C standard: As of version 2.1.0, Spglib explicitly enforces a minimum standard of
  [C11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/11)

## Features

- Find symmetry operations
- Identify space-group type
- Wyckoff position assignment
- Refine crystal structure
- Find a primitive cell
- Search irreducible k-points
